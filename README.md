==========
This program requires a system rom (bios) from the original Neogeo CD console to
function.  This code is copyrighted and therefore you are not entitled to a 
copy unless you own an original Neogeo CD console.

Do not enquire where to find this file.  Suffice to say that it should be called
neocd.bin and should be 512kb in size.

A smaller version of this bios file exists on the internet, however this will no
longer work with DREAMNEO CD(v 1.0 onwards)

DREAMNEO-CD-1.0 IS FREE, SOURCE CODE IS FREE. SELLING IS NOT ALLOWED. 
YOU CAN REUSE SOURCE CODE AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AS LONG AS IT IS NOT FOR

Mathieu Peponas     - The GNGEO source was really useful for information and
                      was really open about licencing files to be compatible 
                      with NeoCD/SDL.
